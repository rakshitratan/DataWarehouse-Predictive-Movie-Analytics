<h3> 3.	Data Model:</h3>

The objective of a data warehouse design is to create a schema that is optimized for decision support processing. The relational model is used in systems where many transactions are executed, most of them concurrently. A transaction inserts, updates or in any other way processes data in a database. In many occasions a transaction is an integral part of the business process. A Relational Database is a set of database tables that are related using keys from other database tables.
